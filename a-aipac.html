            If you’re a UC Berkeley student reading this, open CalCentral. You will notice that there is a new task waiting for you called “Civil Rights and Open Expression.” If you haven’t completed this task, no one can blame you — its generic title and attached 30-minute video hardly make an impression. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But if you sit through the whole 30 minutes, a few moments might stand out. Maybe it’s an offhand remark in the time place and manner section, which suggests that UC Berkeley has banned masks at protests. Maybe it’s the definition of harassment, which includes creating an “offensive environment.” Or maybe, it's the hypothetical instances of discrimination that include a protest of Israel that blocks the path to a building and features slogans like “no Zionists can pass.”
        </p>

        <p>
            This video, tucked away in a corner of the student portal, alludes to a larger conflict that has impacted political speech at all levels of California public education.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time of writing this, California democrats are attempting to define themselves as stalwarts against Trumpism. This self-definition has been challenged by the issue of antisemitism on college campuses. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Through a series of congressional hearings and funding cuts, the Trump administration spun a narrative that campuses had become hotbeds of (leftist) antisemitism. In turn, UC Berkeley handed over the names of 160 students and faculty to the federal government. California lawmakers were relatively silent about this, gesturing towards a broader strategy: proactively policing speech in academic environments, while trying to maintain distance from Trump. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “Just because Donald Trump is abusing anti-Semitism doesn't mean that anti-Semitism somehow doesn't exist,” said Scott Weiner, the co-chair of the California Jewish Caucus, in a press release. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2024, Weiner co-authored the seemingly innocuous SB 1287. Penned primarily by former state representative Steve Glazer, the “Equity in Higher Education Act” demands that the UC Regents and Trustees of the California State University update campus demonstration policies to take a proactive approach in combating “conduct that creates a hostile environment for students on campus.” 
        </p>

        <p>
            SB1287, touted as a generic anti-discrimination bill, was the impetus for the aforementioned video and updates to the UC code of conduct. In an interview with The Intercept, Glazer refuted the idea that the bill was uniquely charged.
        </p>

        <p>
            “People want to make this be about pro-Palestinian, anti-Palestinian bill — I would argue, pro-Hamas, anti-Hamas,” Glazer said. “Whatever framing you want to use to make your case, people are doing that — I’m not.” 
        </p>

        <p>
            Opponents, including California Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), the California Faculty Association and ACLU Cal Action, argued that the bill’s lack of specificity would produce a chilling effect on campus free speech. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Since then, the legislature has turned its eye towards K-12 education. On the two-year anniversary of October 7th, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB715, creating a state-level office of civil rights to review curriculum for perceived antisemitic content. The debate over AB 715 echoed SB 1287.
        </p>

        <p>
            SB1287 and AB715 deploy vague and ostensibly neutral language. While the legislature has not created legal barriers to demonstration, these bills work as a tactic to discourage a wide range of political discourses and actions while maintaining deniability
        </p>

        <p>
            The framework that California lawmakers use to police antisemitism in public schools has been largely influenced by the Jewish Public Affairs Committee, or JPAC. 
        </p>

        <p>
            JPAC has immense influence in the California State legislature. Newsom is a recurring speaker at JPAC’s annual capitol summits, which are routinely attended by ADL lobbyists and a diverse array of state elected officials. This tight-knit relationship is thanks in part to David Bocarsly, the current executive director of JPAC and former director of the Jewish Caucus. 
        </p>


        <p>
            Bocarsly takes pride in SB1287’s openness to interpretation, claiming the biggest “achievement” of SB 1287 lay in a school's ability to “adopt their own policies.” Similarly, Bocarsly notes AB715’s lack of strict content guidelines and definitions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “There is nothing in this bill that defines anti-semitism,” Bocarsly said.
        </p>

        <p>
            For others, this openness to interpretation <i>is</i> the problem. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) announced plans to litigate over the passage of AB715. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “AB 715 doesn't directly say this is how we're defining antisemitism, and I think it's intentional,” said Jenin Younes, the legal director of the ADC. “I think they're giving people the impression that it includes criticism of Israel, or various forms of criticizing Israel and Zionism.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Though Bocarsly refutes any specific definition of antisemitism, he has previously suggested that it is synonymous with anti-Zionism. In an August 2023 JPAC press release, Bocarsly stated that, “there is still a lot of work ahead to implement robust ethnic studies courses across California’s schools that are also free from antisemitism and anti-Zionism.”
        </p>

        <p>
            This echoes the perspective of campus organizers, who have faced mixed messaging following the passage of SB1287. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “We are aware that this generally increases an air of surveillance and sets a precedent for further restrictions.” Said Maya, a member of Berkeley’s JVP.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A few weeks ago, a handful of students staged a teach-in at Doe library — this year’s first test of the updated time, place and manner regulations.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The protest was short-lived. After a couple hours, the students were met by UC police in riot gear and chased out of the library. While no arrests were made, campus spokesperson Dan Mogoluf said that authorities will “seek (protesters) out in an effort to impose appropriate consequences,” clarifying that the protestors wearing masks were violating UC policy. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “I wore a mask because our campus administration has been complicit in systematically suppressing the voices of protesters by using antisemitism,” said a Doe Library protester. “Funnily enough, wearing the mask might get me arrested.”

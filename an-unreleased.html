A little over a week before Charlie Kirk’s squirting, I had campus police called on me at the height of escalation of a purposefully worthless exchange at the TPUSA table. It’s easy to critique their inhumanity and stupidity. Pointless of course, but I was more motivated to troll than to attend a Game Theory lecture (more on the neoliberal normativity of mathematical selfishness soon). 
        </p>


        <p>I didn’t expect the weaponizing the of very institutions they claimed to distrust. How naive of me.</p>

        <p><b>ii. Reflection</b></p>

        <p>Funny, this paradox: this group—bastions of the second amendment—had instantly weaponized an arm of the police state when confronted with uncomfortable language. The career of the late leader of their parent organization is built on this hypocrisy. His org claimed to champion free speech while systematically silencing dissent through institutional power. The man who would later become a martyr for free speech was the mouthpiece of this contradiction that reveals the fundamental lie at the heart of conservative politics: they do not want freedom, they want protection for their ruler’s dominance. More on Marcuse’s repressive tolerance and Žižek's subjective & objective violence later in this article.
        </p>

        <p>My friend first showed me the Instagram reel angles of his assassination. We felt no sympathy that at point in Sodoi <i>(I still have none)</i>. Not shock, and definitely not sorrow. Just the numb and schaden-freude-esque recognition that the violence he continiously defended had finally circled back to its source. Funny, this logical culmination. In hindsight this desensitization troubles me a bit, but it shouldn’t surprise anyone. </p>
 
        <p>Kirk understood this economy of outrage better than anyone. He monetized hatred while pretending to pursue truth. His legacy of debating 19 year old Sophomores were not efforts to persuade but to provoke and monetize backlash of the “tolerant left." The function of the main org, and the TPUSA Berkeley table as an extension, is not about facilitating meaningful dialogue. Its physical presence, turned symbolic, is to manufacture content for conservative media. An important thing that I haven’t really gotten around to investigating, but is very relevant to this, is the spectacle of victimhood that feeds the insatiable appetite of privileged and white conversatives looking for a way to demonstrate their perceived loss of control. John was recently featured on FOX News when “the tolerant left” poured tomato juice or something over his table. Anyways, the shot.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            “I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment.” <br> Charlie Kirk in a Turning Point USA Event in Salt Lake City Utah, April 5, 2023
        </blockquote>

        <p>Funny, this culmination of the cold and utilitarian logic of the marketplace applied to human life. Kirk framed himself as a clear-eyed realist making a "prudent deal" with the devil of mortality, a cost-benefit analysis where the currency was other people's children. He spoke from a position of imagined safety, a theoretical space where "some gun deaths" were a statistical abstraction, a line item in a budget he would never have to pay.</p>

        <p>My generation has never had that luxury. We have come of age scrolling through the digital abyss, our respective short-form media feeds functioning as a ceaseless, algorithmic carousel of inhumanity. On the day Kirk was shot, that digital carousel offered a particularly grotesque triptych:</p>
        <p>
            The Martyr’s Death: Grainy, shaky footage of the assassination itself, looped and analyzed.<br>The Motel Beheading: A clip from Dallas, stark and horrifying, reminding us of violence of a different, more intimate kind.<br>The Yellow Tape: The now-iconic image of another American school, this time in Colorado, wrapped in police tape, the backdrop for yet another shooting that left students dead and injured.
        </p>
        <p>The cruel, poetic coincidence was almost too heavy-handed to be believed. The man who had so clinically justified "some gun deaths" as a necessary expense, was killed by the very product he sold. In the same hour, children in Colorado were paying the exact price he had so casually deemed "worth it." The universe, it seemed, had delivered a brutal lesson in cause and effect, a feedback loop of violence that collapsed the theoretical into the violently real.
        </p>
        <p>This is where the true horror of our modern condition shows: not just in the events themselves, but in our conditioned response to them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The image of a Palestinian child, pulled dust-white and lifeless from the rubble of a bombed-out building in Gaza, had—by the inscrutable logic of the black-box recommender system—already been pushed to the less important pile, deemed less engaging than the spectacle of a pundit's death. Our empathy is not just stretched thin, it is algorithmically curated. The platforms that feed us this horror are designed not to inform, but to engage, and engagement is fueled by outrage, tribalism, and spectacle, not by sustained grief.

        </p>
        <p>We have grown hardened because we’ve had to. The alternative? A psychological collapse under the weight of a world that seems to be fracturing in real-time. This hardening is not apathy; it is a defensive callus, a necessary emotional carapace for surviving the daily onslaught. </p>
        <p>We scroll, we wince, we maybe repost the horrors, and then we click away. The reality is not a sudden breakdown, but a slow, quiet descent into a state of perpetual, low-grade trauma. How sad, this numbed acceptance that this is simply the way things are.</p>
        <p>Kirk’s statement was a telling declaration that some lives are an acceptable sacrifice for an ideological principle. His death, and our numbed reaction to it amidst a panorama of other violence, proves a more terrifying point: that in our digital marketplace of death, all lives are being devalued. We are all becoming subjects in a brutal arithmetic, our worth determined by our click-through rate, our shareability, our utility in the endless culture war. Kirk championed a world where children were statistics. He died in a world where his own death became just another piece of content, competing for our attention with beheadings and school shootings, until the next tragedy inevitably scrolls into view.</p>
        <p>It’s Friday, September 12, and the TPUSA table on campus has a lot more people than it did when I last talked to them. They held a vigil the night before. The spotlight of victimization of the right’s martyr shines bright in all of our feeds. The spectacle of victimhood while actually contributing to the oppression continues.</p>
        
        <p><b>iii. Revolution and a Critique of Neoliberal Infographics</b></p>
        <figure class="article-featured-image">

          </figure>
        <p>The most tragic irony is that well-intentioned infographics are functionally identical to the content they decry. There’s a specific Berkeley flavor to this unknowing hypocrisy.</p>
        <p>To the neoliberal infographic virtue-signalers: You critique political violence from a position of profound comfort, a digital dissent perfectly compatible with the same capitalist platforms and algorithms that profit from the outrage. You are not challenging the system; you are curating a personal brand of consciousness within it. </p>
        <p>
            These people are products of the very system they critique, and their activism is a curated exhibit within it. The infographic is the perfect symbol for this: a complex, systemic problem is simplified, branded, and made consumable. Sharing it can become a substitute for action, a way to feel part of a solution without ever threatening the underlying structures—the university’s endowment investments, the gentrification of the city, the corporate partnerships—that constitute the real, ongoing violence they purport to oppose.
        </p>
        <p>These virtue signalers feed into the same algorithmic machine that monetizes engagement, whether the trigger is outrage at a pundit’s death or outrage at a genocide. Of course it extremely important to share tragedy for action, or resources for action. I am talking about the Berkeley neoliberal, convinced of their ideological opposition—a free content creator for Meta, generating data points that strengthen the very attention economy that commodifies human suffering. They create a narrative of resistance that is instantly absorbed and neutralized by the platform, their critique of violence transformed into a pacified data stream that keeps users scrolling. They believe they are starting a conversation, but they are just feeding the machine, utterly unaware that their tool of liberation is the engine of their containment.
        </p>
        <p>To the people who post infographics but also repost the cool shit happening in Nepal and Indonesia: hell yeah. I am all for taking up arms. I am all for the violence.</p>
        <p>Thie tragic irony is also the ultimate neoliberal sleight of hand: the reduction of revolution to aesthetic. The carefully designed infographic, the well-manicured tweet thread, the podcast lament—all function as what Herbert Marcuse identified as repressive tolerance. By tolerating dissent and even packaging it as a commodity, the system neutralizes its revolutionary potential. The act of posting becomes a substitute for action, a way to perform conscience without confronting the material violence of the state. As Marcuse argued and as my buddy texted while sharing their thoughts on Kirk’s death: “i think it’s ironic and i hate the liberal discourse around political violence.. it just demonstrates liberals’ willingness to maintain the status quo”. We are encouraged to critique, but only within boundaries that ensure no fundamental power is threatened.</p>
        <blockquote>
            “We feel free because we lack the very language to articulate our unfreedom.” <br> Slavoj Žižek, in <i>Welcome to the Desert of the Real: Five Essays on September 11 and Related Dates, 2001</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Žižek’s distinction between subjective and objective violence is such an important thing to keep in mind. The liberal condemnation focuses solely on the subjective violence—the shocking, singular event of Kirk’s murder. This allows them to perform moral outrage while ignoring the objective violence that defines everyday life for millions: the thousand annual police killings, the preventable deaths in ICE detention, the state-sanctioned violence against water protectors at Standing Rock. When a right-wing figure is harmed, it’s a “crisis for democracy”; when police tear gas teenagers or federal agents shoot medics, it is merely the system functioning as designed.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a Marxist perspective, the liberal fetishization of “civility” is a bourgeois fantasy. It ignores the fundamental truth that, as Marx asserted, the state is a instrument of class rule, and its laws—including its monopoly on violence—exist to protect property and power. The “political violence” condemned on CNN is violence that disrupts the ruling class; the daily violence of eviction, wage theft, and environmental racism is sanctioned because it maintains it. The liberal condemnation of Kirk’s murder, while ignoring the genocide in Gaza he cheered on, is the purest expression of this class allegiance. It reveals that their objection is not to violence, but to violence aimed in the wrong direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            True revolution, then, begins with the refusal of this liberal framework. It requires the Marcusiean withdrawal of tolerance toward the Right: a conscious, strategic intolerance for movements that are obviously destructive of the chances for creating a existence without fear and misery. Critiquing peace in this sense is not to call for mindless violence, but for a radical shift in perception: to see the killer cop, the border agent, and the oil executive as the true perpetrators of political violence, and to organize against them with a resolve that no infographic can muster.
        </p>
        <p>Political violence has been the answer. It's just the Left's turn to lean into it.</p>

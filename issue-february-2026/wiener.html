            The rise of fascism in the U.S. presents a more immediate problem. Under President Donald Trump’s administration, we may expect groups committed to guaranteeing a voice and space for the public to be organized radically against the Republican Party. Other organizational problems aside, civic groups could represent a powerful source of opposition to authoritarianism. 
            Nevertheless, CALPIRG’s official <a href="https://calpirgstudents.org/chapters/uc-berkeley/" style="text-decoration:underline;">student website</a> for UC Berkeley continues to proclaim its nonpartisanship with smiling students in front of balloons representing the Democratic and Republican parties.

                    Two years later, Lyons, a Bay Area local, entered his first year as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. Our now-chancellor graduated from the Haas School of Business in 1982 before finding his way back to the school after a career on Wall Street. Lyons climbed the ranks as a professor and eventual dean almost 30 years later.

                    The incoming chancellor promised to uphold university policy, suggesting he would take a strong line against future encampments while protecting free expression.
